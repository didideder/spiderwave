==========

A database of a shit load of radio around the world.
You can find it under db/, it contains around 40 000 radios across the world at the moment.

## ToDo:
    - Golang tester
    - Test if URL is valid, if it's music, and what's the encoding, fill the db with the missing info.
    - Web GUI ? Search ? Add a logo, fill missing fields, add new radio, submit radio for scraping
